# Reinforcement-Learning-Agents
Play various of games using deep learning Tensorflow and deep Evolution Strategies.

## Information

All agents will be trained on RGB frames or feature values native from the game engine.

Right now I got machine limitation, so I am very sorry for late result posting.

ES == Evolution Strategies
DL == Deep Learning

How to read the file, game-folder/algorithm/{features, frames}_{DL, ES}.py

This repository will be update overtime.

## Warning

Do not try any of these code yet, I never tested it before, still in development.
