# Reinforcement-Learning-Agents
### Play various of games using deep learning Tensorflow and deep Evolution Strategies. 

#### *All agents will be trained on RGB frames and feature values native from the game engine.*

Every games will be developed on different algorithms:
1. Reward system on evolution strategies
2. Policy gradient on evolution strategies and deep learning
3. Q-learning on evolution strategies and deep learning
4. Double Q-learning on evolution strategies and deep learning
5. Model-Network on evolution strategies and deep learning
6. Q-learning on Recurrent Neural Network
7. Dueling Q-learning on evolution strategies and deep learning
9. Dueling Double Q-learning on evolution strategies and deep learning
10. Actor-Critic on deep learning
11. Asynchronous Actor-Critic on deep learning

Games that will be developed:
1. Flappy bird
2. level 1 mario
3. pong
4. Catcher
5. Pixelcopter
6. Raycast Maze
7. Snake
8. Water World
9. Dooms

This repository will be update overtime.
