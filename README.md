# Reinforcement-Learning-Agents
### Play various of games using deep learning Tensorflow and deep Evolution Strategies. 

#### *All agents will be trained on RGB frames and feature values native from the game engine.*

Every games will be developed on 2 algorithms:
1. Deep Learning (Bellman equation)
2. Deep Evolution Strategies (Q-Learning bellman equation, reward based)

Games that will be developed:
1. Flappy bird (completed for features and frames based)
2. level 1 mario (completed for frames based only)
3. pong (on training for features and frames based)
4. Catcher (not started yet)
5. Monster Kong (game got bugs)
6. Pixelcopter (completed for features and frames based)
7. Raycast Maze (not started yet)
8. Snake (not started yet)
9. Water World (not started yet)
10. Dooms (not started yet)

This repository will be update overtime.
